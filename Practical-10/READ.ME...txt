10.1 task: Array of Objects in C++
WAP to create a directory that contains the following information.
(a) Name of a person
(b) Address
(c) Telephone Number (if available with STD code)
(d) Mobile Number (if available)
(e) Head of the family

10.2 task: Pointer to Object in C++
WAP to create print or display Student information containing in Student class by using pointers to object.

10.3 task: This pointer in C++
WAP to pass two variables in a parameterized constructor during object creation and have same names variables as class member data and constructor parameters. Your job is to calculate the remainder of those two numbers.

10.4 task: Operator Overloading in C++
a). WAP, in which you write a friend function to overload a less than '<' operator in C++.
b). WAP in which you can add two objects [every object would have 1 integer value] by overloading + operator, which eventually would add the data values of those two object by adding the objects.
